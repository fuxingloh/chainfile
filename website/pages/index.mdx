# Chainfile: A 4-Step Plan to Simplify and Accelerate Blockchain Adoption

A schema-oriented ecosystem packed with compute primitives such as `cpu`, `memory`, `env`, `volume`, `snapshot`,
`endpoint`, and `probes` that can be composed to launch any blockchain node on any container-orchestration platform.

Chainfile promotes decentralization by making it easier to run blockchain nodes,
which can enhance the decentralization of blockchain networks.
Emphasizing the simplicity and accessibility of node operation,
aiming to democratize access
and encourage more individuals and organizations to participate in the blockchain ecosystem.
This approach is intended
to strengthen the decentralized nature of blockchain technology
by enabling a broader base of users to run and manage nodes.

> The motivation behind Chainfile stems from this [blog post by Fuxing Loh](https://fuxing.dev/2024/chainfile)
> where the author describes the need for a simple,
> standardized way to run blockchain nodes.
