# The 4-Step Plan

Chainfile 4-step ecosystem plan to restore the simplicity of running a blockchain node
and return the democratization of access to the blockchain,
regardless of scale, complexity, or tenancy,
to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology regardless of the protocol.

An open-source ecosystem that defines, tests, deploys, and scales blockchain nodes on container orchestration platforms.
While utilizing containers is necessary to take advantage of innovations in container orchestration,
it is a detail that upstream consumers do not have to worry about.

<Steps>

### Define once

Using a simple, non-turing-complete JSON schema that is easy to compose, maintain, and upgrade.

```json filename="@chainfile/bitcoin/mainnet.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://chainfile.org/schema.json",
  "caip2": "bip122:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e93",
  "name": "Bitcoin Mainnet",
  "containers": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Test locally

Using containers to ensure your blockchain application integrates well with the rest of your stack.

```ts filename="app.test.ts"
import definition from '@chainfile/hardhat/localhost.json';

const testcontainers = await ChainfileTestcontainers.start(definition);
```

### Deploy anywhere

Using Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or any other container-orchestration platform.

```shell
chainfile docker synth @chainfile/bitcoin/bitcoind.json

docker compose up
```

### Scale effortlessly

With planet-scale cloud constructs that are future-proof to run on decentralized computing when ready.

```ts filename="cdk8s/chart.ts" {8-11}
import { ChainfileChart } from 'chainfile-cdk8s';
import mainnet from '@chainfile/geth-lighthouse/mainnet.json';

class App extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: App, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new ChainfileChart(this, 'geth-lighthouse', {
      definition: mainnet,
      spec: { replicas: 1 },
    });
  }
}
```

</Steps>
