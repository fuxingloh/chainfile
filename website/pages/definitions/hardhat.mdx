Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software.
You can use Hardhat directly within your Node.js.
This definition provides a containerized version of Hardhat for local toolchain isolation,
which is particularly useful for language-agnostic development and testing parallelization.
